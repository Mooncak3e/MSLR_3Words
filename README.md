# Project Title

Myanmar Sign Language Recognition Application (Word Level).

## Description

Instances of discrimination against disabled individuals are prevalent worldwide. In various facets of life, such as careers or social activities, disabled people encounter unfairness. Among them, deaf people face significant difficulties, as most individuals lack awareness of how to communicate or learn sign language to interact with them. As a result, our team aimed to take the first step in bridging the gap between deaf and non-deaf individuals by developing a platform that facilitates understanding of sign language, enabling communication at one's fingertips. Therefore, we created an AI model that can detect sign language using webcams and mobile phone cameras. Our primary objectives are as follows:

- To translate Myanmar Sign Language at the word level.
- To provide the first applicable use of Myanmar Sign Language detection.
- To lead the ongoing research on this project.

Our team comprises four passionate youths from a technology background who aim to support the disabled community in Myanmar.
